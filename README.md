# Predict Sale Price for Heavy Equipment using Random Forest Bulldozers &middot;
> The program follows a similar structure as one demonstrated in fastai courses
> Objective : Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.

The Project provides a step by step method toPredict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.and goes deeper into understanding data and their relationships to improve the accuracy of the models developed. The project is an attempt to the Kaggle competition for [Blue Book for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers)

The Project explores tree structures, oob scores, reduces over-fitting and concepts of bagging in a structured manner

## Installing / Getting started

You need to use fastai 0.7; please follow the installation instructions [here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v0-install-issues-thread/24652)  .


## Developing

### Built With
fastai 0.7, sklearn libraries

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.
NVidia GPU with programming framework CUDA is helpful for training and testing the models

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Set the PATH variable to your relavant folder location
```shell
git clone https://github.com/anandpuntambekar/Random_Forest_Bulldosers.git
cd Random_Forest_Bulldosers/
```


## Style guide

The notebook is well commented explaining in technical details each and every step of the process end to end. This includes exploring the data, Model exploration, Model selection, Model tuning, Model testing and analysing the methods

## Database
The data for the project can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)




# Random_Forest_Bulldosers
This notebook is an experiment with Random forest models from sklearn and Fast.ai libraries. It is based on Jeremy Howards lecture on introduction to Machine learning
